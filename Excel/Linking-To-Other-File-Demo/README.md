Excel Demo - Linking to Another File
---

Included are two files showing how to access cells in another Excel file. 

* `file1.xlsx` has the cell that will be accessed. 

* `file2.xlsx` pulls in cell A1 from `file1.xlsx`.

I've included the formula that is used in text form in `file2` so you can easily see the syntax of the formula, which is:

```
    [Filename]SheetName!CellReference
```
